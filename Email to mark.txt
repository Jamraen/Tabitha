Dear Mark.

As Kim may have mentioned to you, I am working on a capstone technology project. I would like to focus on increasing the re-wear of garments and decreasing the amount of amount of clothing landfill through increasing the amount of garment resale. 

I'm looking at ways technology can be used to make it easier to resale garments.

Would you be willing to advise me in this process, and answer some questions about your process on consigning and reselling garments? If you are willing, when and what time would be convenient to have a discussion? 

I'm free Monday 26/1/26, Tuesday 27/1/26, and most of Wednesday 28/1/26 next week before school restarts. Alternatively, let me know a time that works for you.

Thank you!
