My assumption is that listing is the most difficult part. I will ask stakeholder if that's true, or if it's something else to check I'm working on the most important part of the problem.
Buyers perspective: Go on website, search for key words of clothing they want (e.g blue, denim, pants, size, etc.), add items found to cart, pay, receive shipped item.
Sellers perspective: Go on website, purchase clean out kit, receive clean out kit, clean out clothing, fill out consignment form, send clothing in, receive either money, clothing back or notice of clothing donation.
Site-Owners perspective: Receive purchase of clean out kit, ship clean out kit, receive consignment form/clothing, create seller account/receive seller account, inspect clothing/take measurements, store clothing, save storage location, associate clothing with seller account, decide price and key descriptive words, take photos, list product -> Branching path 1: Receive money from buyer, pay consigner their cut. Branching path 2: 12 weeks pass, reduce price by up to 50% and either return to branching path 1, or continue to branching path 3. Branching path 3: No buyer after 12 months, either return clothing to consigner or donate clothing to charity depending on consigner's decision.
