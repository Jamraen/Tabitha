Part 1 - The problem
Context
How many tons of clothing is disposed of each year? How many tons of that clothing could have been reused/recycled? How much clothing is reused/recycled each year? Australia/NZ versus world stats? In what way is clothing recycled/reused (e.g sold online, auctioned online, in person, donated, hand-me-downs, op shop, on consignment.)? Clothing makes up a large amount of pollution and landfill, uses resources such as growing cotton which needs farmers, farmland, water and pesticides. Talk about current global resell market.
The problem
Selling clothing can be time consuming and difficult, which increases the likelihood that a garment ends up in landfill rather than reused or recycled. I want to make a machine that will make reselling garments easier. Ten steps that go into reselling a garment: 1; Checking for damage/stains. 2; Checking for original cost of garment. 3; pricing the garment. 4; describing the garment. 5; composition and care. 6; ocular observation of the garment. 7; photograph. 8; sizing the garment. 9; specifications (e.g fabric, season, style, etc.). 10; listing the garment e.g on website. 11; Give unique ID. 12; routing garment for in person sale. 13; storage.
